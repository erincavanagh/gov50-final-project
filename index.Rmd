## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the impact that environmental hazards have on the health of the population. I plan of stydying tis relationship by observing the possible relationship between an individual's likelihood of receiving a diagnosis of a specified disease (most likely a respiratory disorder) and their relative distance to a power plant that emits pollution. The control group will consist of individuals who reside in an area with no power plants. 

To investigate this relationship, I will begin by researching the following databases:
